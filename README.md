## Abstract
Geophysical inversions produce physical property models that are
interpreted to provide geologic information. In this work, we leverage
segmentation methods to promote the recovery of geologic structures in
the inversion. The segmentation is incorporated into the inversion by
adding a regularized segmentation as terms to the objective function.
The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is used to solve
the optimization problem. To demonstrate our approach, we present a
synthetic DC resistivity example and an inversion of field MT data.
